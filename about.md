		<p>Hello! I am a student working on my <a href="https://www.compling.uw.edu/">MS in Computational Lingusitics</a> at the University of Washington (UW). Before my studies at UW, I received my B.A. degree in Foreign Languages and Literature from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), and worked as a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.nlplab.cc/">NLP Lab</a> at NTHU.</p>
		<p>My research interests are (1) methods that incorporate linguistics/psycholinguistics in improving the generalizability and interpretability of NLP applications, and (2) the computational modeling of linguistic phenomena.</p>
		<p>Currently, under the supervision of <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/">Prof. Emily M. Bender</a>, I am working on my master's thesis in inferring information about the valence-changing morphology of a given language from its interlinear glossed text (IGT).</p>
