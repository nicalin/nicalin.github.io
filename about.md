		<p>Hello! I am a student working on my <a herf="https://www.compling.uw.edu/">MS in Computational Lingusitics</a> at the University of Washington (UW). Before my studies at UW, I received my B.A. degree in Foreign Languages and Literature from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), and worked as a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.nlplab.cc/">NLP Lab</a> at NTHU.</p>
		<p>My research interests are (1) methods that incorporate linguistics/psycholinguistics in improving the generalizability and interpretability of NLP applications, and (2) the computational modeling of linguistic phenomena.</p>
		<p>Currently, I am working on my master's thesis in inferring information abuot the valence-changing morphology of a given language from interlinear glossed text (IGT).</p>
<!-- 		<p>Hello! I am a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.nlplab.cc/">NLP Lab</a> at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).</p> -->
<!-- 		<p>Before my work as a research assistant, I completed my undergraduate studies at NTHU and received my B.A. degree in Foreign Languages and Literature. Till now, I dabbled in different linguistic fields such as psycholinguistics and computational linguistics / NLP. The psycholingusitics projects I participated in surround <i>Government and Binding</i> theory of Mandarin Chinese and English L2 acquisition. On the other hand, my computational linguistic experiences are about word meanings (Sense Alignment and Word Sense Disambiguation), and the automatic generation of Chinese Pattern Grammar.</p> -->
<!-- 		<p>My interests lie in computational linguistics / NLP. More specifically, my interest is in text processing. I am particularly interested in incorporating linguistic knowledge into computational linguistics / NLP applications.</p> -->
